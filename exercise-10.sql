## Exercise 10
-- Based on the previous exercise, you can now try to create a third function that also accepts a second
-- parameter. Let this parameter be a character sequence. Evaluate if its value is 'min' or 'max' and based on
-- that retrieve either the lowest or the highest salary, respectively (using the same logic and code structure
-- from Exercise 9). If the inserted value is any string value different from ‘min’ or ‘max’, let the function
-- return the difference between the highest and the lowest salary of that employee.
